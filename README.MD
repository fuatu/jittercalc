# JitterCalc

We SREs in Trilogy as remote workers need to check the network quality as our connection 
is very important for our work. Also we need jitter calculation for some of the services or 
for interconnectivity of DCs. 

I was looking for a solution but couldn't find one.
So developed this one, free to use for everyone.
